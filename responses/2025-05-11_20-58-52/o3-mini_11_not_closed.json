    "prompt": "You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. \nYou must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. \nAll of the syntax rules that you need are contained in the tutorial text file. \nThe syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. \nPay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. \nBe as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple \"for all\" or \"there exists\" steps, add an updated \"We need to show that...\" line to the proof each time you address such a step. It is always better to add such a step than to omit one.\nVERY IMPORTANT: When using multiple levels of indentation, avoid repeating the same symbol for deeper levels. For example, if you've used an asterisk (*) at one level, use a different symbol like a hyphen (-) for the next.\nMake sure you also follow the syntax (& x < y < z) for multiple (in)equalities, as detailed in the tutorial. \nAs your output, provide everything found between the \"Proof.\" line and the \"Qed.\" line in Waterproof syntax.\nBelow is the tutorial, followed by the lemma to be proven:\n",
