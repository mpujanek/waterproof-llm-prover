## Prompt:

    You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. 
You must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. 
All of the syntax rules that you need are contained in the tutorial text file. 
The syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. 
Pay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. 
Be as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple "for all" or "there exists" steps, add an updated "We need to show that..." line to the proof each time you address such a step. It is always better to add such a step than to omit one.
VERY IMPORTANT: When using multiple levels of indentation, avoid repeating the same symbol for deeper levels. For example, if you've used an asterisk (*) at one level, use a different symbol like a hyphen (-) for the next.
Make sure you also follow the syntax (& x < y < z) for multiple (in)equalities, as detailed in the tutorial. 
As your output, provide everything found between the "Proof." line and the "Qed." line in Waterproof syntax.
Below is the tutorial, followed by the lemma to be proven:

Variable f : ℝ → ℝ.
Variable g : ℝ → ℝ.

Lemma exercise_3_11_4 :
  (∀ M1 ∈ ℝ, ∃ y > 0, ∀ x > y, f (x) > M1) ⇒
    (∀ M2 < 4, ∃ z > 0, ∀ x > z, g (x) > M2) ⇒
      ∃ c ∈ ℝ, f(c) + g(c) > 10.
Proof.


    ## Response:

    Assume that (∀ M1 ∈ ℝ, ∃ y > 0, ∀ x > y, f(x) > M1) (premise1).
Assume that (∀ M2 < 4, ∃ z > 0, ∀ x > z, g(x) > M2) (premise2).

Use M1 := (7) in (premise1).
* Indeed, (7 ∈ ℝ).
* It holds that (∃ y > 0, ∀ x > y, f(x) > 7).
  Obtain such a y.

Use M2 := (3.5) in (premise2).
* Indeed, (3.5 < 4).
* It holds that (∃ z > 0, ∀ x > z, g(x) > 3.5).
  Obtain such a z.

Choose c := (max(y, z) + 1).
* Indeed, (c ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (f(c) + g(c) > 10).
  It holds that (c > y).
  It holds that (∀ x > y, f(x) > 7).
  It holds that (f(c) > 7).
  It holds that (c > z).
  It holds that (∀ x > z, g(x) > 3.5).
  It holds that (g(c) > 3.5).
  It holds that (f(c) + g(c) > 7 + 3.5).
  It holds that (7 + 3.5 = 10.5).
  It holds that (10.5 > 10).
  We conclude that (f(c) + g(c) > 10).
