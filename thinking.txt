I need to write a proof for the given lemma using Waterproof syntax. Let me break down what the lemma is saying:

For all real numbers x, there exists a real number y, such that for all positive u, there exists a positive v, such that x + u < y + v.

Now, let's think about how to prove this:

1. Take an arbitrary x in R
2. We need to find a suitable y in R
3. Then, for any positive u, we need to find a positive v such that x + u < y + v

Let's think about choosing y. Since we're trying to make x + u < y + v, and both u and v are positive, let's try setting y = x. Then, the inequality becomes x + u < x + v, which simplifies to u < v. This means for any u > 0, we need to find a v > 0 such that u < v. We can always choose v = u + 1 or any value larger than u.

Let me write the proof:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    It holds that (v = u + 1).
    We conclude that (& x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Wait, let me double-check this. We have:
- y = x
- v = u + 1

The inequality we want to prove is x + u < y + v.
Substituting: x + u < x + (u + 1) = x + u + 1

So x + u < x + u + 1, which is true because 0 < 1.

However, I should review my approach to make sure I'm following the Waterproof syntax correctly. Let me rewrite this to ensure I'm using the proper format:

1. Take x ∈ ℝ.
2. Choose y := (x).
   * Prove y ∈ ℝ.
   * Prove ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v.
3. Take u > 0.
4. Choose v := (u + 1).
   * Prove v > 0.
   * Prove x + u < y + v.

Now let me make sure my syntax is correct based on the tutorial examples:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    It holds that (v = u + 1).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Wait, I think I made a mistake with the indentation levels. Let me adjust that based on the examples in the tutorial:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  * Indeed, (v > 0).
  * We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    It holds that (v = u + 1).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Wait, I see that in the tutorial, when there are multiple indentation levels, we should avoid repeating the same symbol. Let me fix that:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    It holds that (v = u + 1).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

But actually, looking at the tutorial more carefully, I think I'm still making a mistake with the format. Let me look at the examples again to see the proper way to structure proofs with quantifiers:

From the example "Combine for-all and there-exists statements":
```
Take a ∈ (ℝ).
Take b > 5.
Choose c := (b - a + 1).
* Indeed, (c ∈ ℝ).
* We conclude that (c > b - a).
```

And from "Use a for-all statement":
```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Assume that (∀ ε > 0, x < ε) (i).
Use ε := (1/2) in (i).
* Indeed, (1 / 2 > 0).
* It holds that  (x < 1 / 2).
  We conclude that (x + 1/2 < 1).
```

And from "Use a there-exists statement":
```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Assume that (∃ y > 10, y < x) (i).
Obtain such a y.
We conclude that (& 10 < y < x).
```

So, based on these examples, I think I should structure my proof like this:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* Take u > 0.
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

But I still want to make sure I'm doing this right. The lemma statement involves a nested "for all" and "there exists", and the tutorial doesn't have an example of exactly this form. Let's think about it in a more methodical way:

1. Take x ∈ ℝ.
2. Find y ∈ ℝ.
3. For any u > 0, find v > 0 such that x + u < y + v.

So, we need to:
1. Take x ∈ ℝ.
2. Choose y := (x).
3. Prove y ∈ ℝ (easy, since x ∈ ℝ).
4. Take any u > 0.
5. Choose v := (u + 1).
6. Prove v > 0 (easy, since u > 0).
7. Prove x + u < y + v, which, given our choices, is x + u < x + (u + 1) = x + u + 1, which is true.

Let me try writing the proof again with this structure:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Looking at the examples more closely, I think the way to interpret the correct structure is that each "We need to show that..." should correspond to a distinct "for all" or "there exists" step in the lemma, and it should be updated each time we address one of these steps.

Let me revise one more time:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Actually, from looking at the tutorial examples, I think I need to simplify my approach. Let me rewrite the proof one more time:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* Take u > 0.
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We conclude that (x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

Hmm, but when I look at the example for "Combine for-all and there-exists statements", it doesn't include "We need to show that..." statements for every quantifier. Let me try to match the style of that example, but adding the "We need to show that..." statements as mentioned in the instructions:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    It holds that (u + 1 > u).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
```

Looking at the tutorial more carefully, I notice that when using `Choose`, we use asterisks for the subsequent indentation. When using another level of indentation after that, we use hyphens. So let me fix the indentation:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    It holds that (y = x).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
```

But now I'm doubting myself. Let me check the "Combine for-all and there-exists statements" example from the tutorial again:

```
Take a ∈ (ℝ).
Take b > 5.
Choose c := (b - a + 1).
* Indeed, (c ∈ ℝ).
* We conclude that (c > b - a).
```

It doesn't seem like the example includes "We need to show that..." statements. Let me look at some of the other examples to see if they include these statements when dealing with nested quantifiers.

In the section "Prove two statements: A ∧ B", the example does include "We need to show that..." statements:

```
Take x ∈ (ℝ).
We show both statements.
* We need to show that (x^2 ≥ 0).
  We conclude that (x^2 ≥ 0).
* We need to show that (| x | ≥ 0).
  We conclude that (| x | ≥  0).
```

But this is in the context of proving two statements, which is different from our lemma.

In the "Argue by contradiction" example, a "We need to show that..." statement is used:

```
Take x ∈ (ℝ).
Assume that (∀ ε > 0, x > 1 - ε) (i).
We need to show that (x ≥ 1).
We argue by contradiction.
Assume that (¬ (x ≥ 1)).
It holds that ((1 - x) > 0).
By (i) it holds that (x > 1 - (1 - x)).
Contradiction.
```

So, the use of "We need to show that..." seems to vary based on the context. However, the instructions mention:

"Be as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple "for all" or "there exists" steps, add an updated "We need to show that..." line to the proof each time you address such a step. It is always better to add such a step than to omit one."

Let me rewrite my proof to include the "We need to show that..." statements as instructed:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
```

I'm starting to think that my approach is correct, and the differences I'm seeing in the tutorial examples are due to the context and the complexity of the lemmas being proven. The general pattern seems to be that "We need to show that..." is used to clarify what we're trying to prove, especially in complex proofs.

Let me do one final check on the indentation and the structure:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
```

This seems correct to me now. I've used "We need to show that..." each time I address a quantifier, and I've used different indentation symbols for different levels. I think this is the correct format based on the instructions and the tutorial examples.

Actually, I think we can simplify the last step a bit. Let me adjust:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1)).
```

But I'm not sure if this is correct either. When I look at the tutorial example for "Chains of (in)equalities", it uses the `&` symbol:

```
By (f_increasing) we conclude that (& 2 < f(0) ≤ f(1)).
```

So I should use `&` to indicate that I'm showing multiple steps or relations. Let me adjust:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (& x + u < x + u + 1 = y + v).
```

I believe this is the correct format for the proof. Let me review it one more time:

1. We take an arbitrary x ∈ ℝ.
2. We choose y to be x. This is a valid choice since x ∈ ℝ.
3. For any u > 0, we choose v = u + 1.
4. We need to show that x + u < y + v. Given our choices, this is x + u < x + (u + 1), which simplifies to x + u < x + u + 1, which is true because 0 < 1.

I think this proof works and the format is correct based on the tutorial and the instructions. Let me make on adjustment; at the beginning I find it's more natural to just state what we need to show at the beginning:

```
Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
```

So my final proof is:

Take x ∈ ℝ.
We need to show that (∃ y ∈ ℝ, ∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
Choose y := (x).
* Indeed, (y ∈ ℝ).
* We need to show that (∀ u > 0, ∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Take u > 0.
  We need to show that (∃ v > 0, x + u < y + v).
  Choose v := (u + 1).
  - Indeed, (v > 0).
  - We need to show that (x + u < y + v).
    We conclude that (x + u < x + (u + 1) = y + v).
