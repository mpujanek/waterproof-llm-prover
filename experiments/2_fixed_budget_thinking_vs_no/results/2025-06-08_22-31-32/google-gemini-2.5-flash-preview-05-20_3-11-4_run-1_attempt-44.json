So exists Z such that for X > Z, g(X) > 0.\n          \n          Let's restart the M1 and M2 selection to make f(c) big enough to cover the sum.\n          Set M1 for f to be 10.\n          Set M2 for g to be 0 (since 0 < 4). Then g(c) > 0.\n          So, f(c) + g(c) > 10 + 0 = 10. This approach works.\n          Okay, let's use M1 = 10 and M2 = 0.\n        *)\n       Use M1 := (10) in (i).\n       --- Indeed, (10 \u2208 \u211d).\n       --- It holds that (\u2203 y > 0, \u2200 x > y, f(x) > 10) (y_big_fact).\n         Obtain such a y_0_big.\n       \n       Use M2 := (0) in (ii).\n       --- Indeed, (0 < 4).\n       --- It holds that (\u2203 z > 0, \u2200 x > z, g(x) > 0) (z_positive_fact).\n         Obtain such a z_0_positive.\n       \n       Choose c := (max(y_0_big, z_0_positive) + 1).\n       --- Indeed, (c \u2208 \u211d).\n       --- We need to show that (f(c) + g(c) > 10).\n          It suffices to show that (f(c) > 10).\n          ---- We conclude that (c > y_0_big).\n          ---- It holds that (f(c) > 10).\n          ---- We conclude that (f(c) > 10).\n          It suffices to show that (g(c) > 0).\n          ---- We conclude that (c > z_0_positive).\n          ---- It holds that (g(c) > 0).\n          ---- We conclude that (g(c) > 0).\n          We conclude that (& f(c) + g(c) > 10 + 0 = 10).\nQed.\n```",
