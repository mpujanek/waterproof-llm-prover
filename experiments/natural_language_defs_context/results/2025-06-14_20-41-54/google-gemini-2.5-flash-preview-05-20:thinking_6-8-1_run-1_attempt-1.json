    "output": "Below is the natural language interpretation and proof draft, followed by the Waterproof proof.\n\nThe statement to be proven, `(a is _bounded_) \u21d4 (a is _bounded above_ \u2227 a is _bounded below_)`, can be interpreted as follows:\nA sequence `a` (mapping natural numbers to real numbers) is defined as \"bounded\" if there exists a positive real number `M` such that the absolute value of every term `a(n)` in the sequence is less than or equal to `M`.\nThe sequence `a` is defined as \"bounded above\" if there exists a real number `M_upper` such that every term `a(n)` in the sequence is less than or equal to `M_upper`.\nThe sequence `a` is defined as \"bounded below\" if there exists a real number `m_lower` such that every term `a(n)` in the sequence is greater than or equal to `m_lower`.\nThe lemma asserts that these two conditions are equivalent: a sequence is bounded if and only if it is simultaneously bounded above and bounded below.\n\nNatural Language Proof Draft:\n\nWe need to prove this equivalence in two directions.\n\n**Direction 1: If a sequence is bounded, then it is bounded above AND bounded below.**\n1.  Assume that the sequence `a` is bounded. By definition, this means there exists some `M_abs > 0` such that for all natural numbers `n`, `|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs`.\n2.  From the property of absolute values, `|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs` implies that `-M_abs \u2264 a(n) \u2264 M_abs` for all `n`.\n3.  To show that `a` is bounded above: We can choose `M_upper := M_abs`. Since we know `a(n) \u2264 M_abs` for all `n`, it follows that `a(n) \u2264 M_upper` for all `n`. Therefore, `a` is bounded above.\n4.  To show that `a` is bounded below: We can choose `m_lower := -M_abs`. Since we know `-M_abs \u2264 a(n)` for all `n`, it follows that `m_lower \u2264 a(n)` for all `n`. Therefore, `a` is bounded below.\n5.  Since `a` is both bounded above and bounded below, this direction of the equivalence is proven.\n\n**Direction 2: If a sequence is bounded above AND bounded below, then it is bounded.**\n1.  Assume that the sequence `a` is bounded above AND `a` is bounded below. By definition, this means:\n    *   There exists a real number `M_upper` such that for all `n`, `a(n) \u2264 M_upper`.\n    *   There exists a real number `m_lower` such that for all `n`, `m_lower \u2264 a(n)`.\n2.  Combining these two facts, for any natural number `n`, we know that `m_lower \u2264 a(n) \u2264 M_upper`.\n3.  Our goal is to show that `a` is bounded, meaning we need to find a `M_abs > 0` such that `|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs` for all `n`.\n4.  From the inequality `m_lower \u2264 a(n) \u2264 M_upper`, it is a standard property that `|a(n)| \u2264 max(|m_lower|, |M_upper|)`. Let's denote `M_candidate := max(|m_lower|, |M_upper|)`.\n5.  We need to ensure our chosen `M_abs` is strictly positive. `M_candidate` might be zero (if `m_lower = 0` and `M_upper = 0`, meaning `a(n) = 0` for all `n`) or even negative if absolute values were not taken (but they are, so `M_candidate \u2265 0`). To guarantee `M_abs > 0`, we choose `M_abs := max(M_candidate, 1)`. This selection ensures `M_abs` is always greater than or equal to 1, and thus strictly positive.\n6.  Since for all `n`, `|a(n)| \u2264 M_candidate` (from step 4), and `M_candidate \u2264 M_abs` (by definition of `M_abs`), we can conclude that `|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs` for all `n`.\n7.  Thus, `a` is bounded, completing the proof of this direction.\n\n**Tactics to be Used:**\n\n*   **Show both directions:** For proving the `\u21d4` (if and only if) statement.\n*   **Make an assumption:** To clearly state the premise for each direction.\n*   **Obtain such a... according to (...):** To extract values from existential premises.\n*   **Choose ... := (...):** To define a value for an existential quantifier we are trying to prove.\n*   **Take ... \u2208 (...):** To introduce an arbitrary variable for a universal quantifier.\n*   **We show both statements:** To prove a logical conjunction `A \u2227 B`.\n*   **We need to show that (...):** To state the immediate goal within the proof.\n*   **It holds that (...):** For stating established facts or obvious deductions.\n*   **We conclude that (...):** For the final step of a sub-proof or the overall proof, often used with `&` for chains of inequalities/equalities.\n*   **Nested Indentation Symbols:** Adhering strictly to the rule of using different indentation symbols (`*`, `-`, `+`, `~`, etc.) for deeper levels of focused goals.\n\n```\nProof.\nBy application_of_prop_5_2_2 it suffices to show that\n  ((\u2203 M > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, | a(n) | \u2264 M)\n    \u21d4\n  (a is _bounded above_ \u2227 a is _bounded below_)).\nWe need to show that ((\u2203 M > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M)\n                        \u21d4 (\u2203 M_upper_name \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_name) \u2227 (\u2203 m_lower_name \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_name \u2264 a(n))).\nWe show both directions.\n++ We need to show that ((\u2203 M_abs > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M_abs)\n                          \u21d2 ((\u2203 M_upper_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val) \u2227 (\u2203 m_lower_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_val \u2264 a(n)))).\n   Assume that (\u2203 M_abs > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M_abs) (i).\n   Obtain M_abs_val according to (i).\n   We show both statements.\n   * We need to show that (\u2203 M_upper_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val).\n     Choose M_upper_val := (M_abs_val).\n     - Indeed, (M_abs_val \u2208 \u211d).\n     - We need to show that (\u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val).\n       Take n \u2208 \u2115.\n       We need to show that (a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val).\n       + By (i) it holds that (|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs_val).\n       + We conclude that (a(n) \u2264 M_abs_val).\n   * We need to show that (\u2203 m_lower_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_val \u2264 a(n)).\n     Choose m_lower_val := (-M_abs_val).\n     - Indeed, (-M_abs_val \u2208 \u211d).\n     - We need to show that (\u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_val \u2264 a(n)).\n       Take n \u2208 \u2115.\n       We need to show that (m_lower_val \u2264 a(n)).\n       + By (i) it holds that (|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs_val).\n       + We conclude that (-M_abs_val \u2264 a(n)).\n++ We need to show that (((\u2203 M_upper_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val) \u2227 (\u2203 m_lower_val \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_val \u2264 a(n))))\n                          \u21d2 (\u2203 M_abs > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M_abs)).\n   Assume that (\u2203 M_upper_val_from_assump \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val_from_assump) (j_upper).\n   Assume that (\u2203 m_lower_val_from_assump \u2208 \u211d, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, m_lower_val_from_assump \u2264 a(n)) (j_lower).\n   Obtain M_upper_val according to (j_upper).\n   Obtain m_lower_val according to (j_lower).\n   We need to show that (\u2203 M_abs > 0, \u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M_abs).\n   Choose M_abs_val := (max(max(|m_lower_val|, |M_upper_val|), 1)).\n   * Indeed, (M_abs_val \u2208 \u211d).\n   * Indeed, (M_abs_val > 0).\n   * We need to show that (\u2200 n \u2208 \u2115, |a(n)| \u2264 M_abs_val).\n     Take n \u2208 \u2115.\n     ~ We need to show that (|a(n)| \u2264 M_abs_val).\n     ~ It holds that (m_lower_val \u2264 a(n)).\n     ~ It holds that (a(n) \u2264 M_upper_val).\n     ~ It holds that (|a(n)| \u2264 max(|m_lower_val|, |M_upper_val|)).\n     ~ We conclude that (& |a(n)| \u2264 max(|m_lower_val|, |M_upper_val|) \u2264 max(max(|m_lower_val|, |M_upper_val|), 1) = M_abs_val).\nQed.\n```",
