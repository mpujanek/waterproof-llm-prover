    "prompt": "You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. \nYou must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. \nAll of the syntax rules that you need are contained in a tutorial below. \nThe syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. \nPay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. \nBe as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple \"for all\" or \"there exists\" steps, add an updated \"We need to show that...\" line to the proof each time you address such a step. \nIt is always fine to recall what needs to be shown, hence it is better to add such a step than to omit one.\nVERY IMPORTANT: When using multiple levels of indentation for focusing goals, avoid repeating the same symbol for deeper levels. \nFor example, if you've used an asterisk (*) at one level, use a different symbol, like a hyphen (-), for the next.\nBelow is the tutorial:\n\n***tutorial***\n\nBefore you start writing the Waterproof proof itself, please start by interpreting (in natural language) what is the statement to be proven. \nAfter that, write a natural language proof of your statement, which will serve as a draft for the Waterproof proof. \nThen, to help think ahead, explain which tactics from the tutorial you plan to use in your Waterproof proof. \nAt the end of your output, you should provide your Waterproof proof.\nThis should be pure Waterproof code, starting with \"Proof.\" and ending with \"Qed.\". Do not enclose it in a code block and do not use backticks, simple plaintext is best. \nBelow is the lemma to be proven: \n",

    "output": "The statement to be proven is `\u00ac ([0,1) is _closed_)`.\nIn natural language, this means: The interval `[0,1)` is not a closed set.\n\n## Natural Language Proof Draft\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We want to demonstrate that the set `[0,1)` is not closed.\n2.  **Strategy: Proof by Contradiction.** Assume `[0,1)` *is* closed and derive a contradiction.\n3.  **Definition of Closed Set:** A set `A` is closed if and only if its complement `\u211d\\A` is open. Therefore, if we assume `[0,1)` is closed, it implies that its complement, `\u211d\\[0, 1)` (which is `(-\u221e, 0) U [1, \u221e)`), must be an open set.\n4.  **Definition of Open Set (Expanded):** A set `S` is open if and only if for every point `a` in `S`, there exists an `r > 0` such that the entire open ball `B(a, r)` is contained within `S`. This can be formally written as: `\u2200 a, (S a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), x \u2208 S)`.\n5.  **Forming the Contradiction:** If `\u211d\\[0, 1)` is open (our assumption for contradiction), then *all* its points are interior points. To contradict this, we need to find *one* specific point `a` such that:\n    a. `a` belongs to `\u211d\\[0, 1)`.\n    b. `a` is *not* an interior point of `\u211d\\[0, 1)`.\n    A point `a` is *not* an interior point if, for *every* `r > 0`, the ball `B(a, r)` is *not* entirely contained in `\u211d\\[0, 1)`. This means that for every `r > 0`, there exists some `x` in `B(a, r)` such that `x` is *not* in `\u211d\\[0, 1)`. Since `\u211d\\[0, 1)` is the complement of `[0,1)`, `x \u2209 \u211d\\[0, 1)` is equivalent to `x \u2208 [0,1)`.\n6.  **Choosing a Candidate Point `a`:** Let's consider the boundary points of the original interval `[0,1)`, which are `0` and `1`.\n    *   `0` is not in `\u211d\\[0, 1)` (it's in `[0,1)`). So `0` is not suitable.\n    *   `1` *is* in `\u211d\\[0, 1)` (specifically, `1 \u2208 [1, \u221e)`). Let's choose `a = 1`.\n7.  **Proving `a=1` is Not an Interior Point of `\u211d\\[0, 1)`:** We need to show that for any `r > 0`, there exists an `x` such that `x \u2208 B(1, r)` (i.e., `1-r < x < 1+r`) AND `x \u2208 [0,1)`.\n8.  **Finding `x`:** For any given `r > 0`, let's propose `x = 1 - min(r/2, 1)`.\n    *   **Is `x \u2208 B(1, r)`?** We need `|x - 1| < r`.\n        `|x - 1| = |(1 - min(r/2, 1)) - 1| = |-min(r/2, 1)| = min(r/2, 1)`.\n        Since `r > 0`, `r/2 > 0`. Therefore, `min(r/2, 1)` is positive. Also, `min(r/2, 1) \u2264 r/2`. Since `r/2 < r`, we have `min(r/2, 1) < r`. This confirms `x \u2208 B(1, r)`.\n    *   **Is `x \u2208 [0,1)`?** We need `0 \u2264 x < 1`.\n        *   **`x < 1`:** Since `min(r/2, 1) > 0`, `x = 1 - min(r/2, 1)` will always be strictly less than `1`.\n        *   **`x \u2265 0`:** We consider two cases for `r`:\n            *   **Case 1: `r/2 < 1` (i.e., `r < 2`)**\n                In this case, `min(r/2, 1) = r/2`. So `x = 1 - r/2`. Since `r < 2`, `r/2 < 1`, which means `1 - r/2 > 0`. So `x \u2265 0` holds.\n            *   **Case 2: `r/2 \u2265 1` (i.e., `r \u2265 2`)**\n                In this case, `min(r/2, 1) = 1`. So `x = 1 - 1 = 0`. This satisfies `x \u2265 0`.\n    In both cases, `x \u2208 [0,1)` holds.\n9.  **Conclusion:** We have found a point `a=1` such that `a \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1)` and `a` is *not* an interior point of `\u211d\\[0, 1)`. This contradicts our initial assumption that `\u211d\\[0, 1)` is an open set (by its full definition). Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, meaning `[0,1)` is not closed.\n\n## Tactics to be Used\n\n1.  **`We need to show that`**: Used to state the main goal and subsequent sub-goals.\n2.  **`We argue by contradiction.`**: The main proof strategy.\n3.  **`Assume that`**: Used to state the assumption for the contradiction. The \"Wrong assumption specified\" error implies that defined terms like `is_open_` must be expanded to their underlying quantified definitions when used in an `Assume` statement.\n4.  **`It holds that`**: Used to derive implications from definitions (e.g., from the full definition of an open set using the chosen `a`).\n5.  **`Choose`**: Used to instantiate an existential claim (e.g., to pick the counterexample point `a`, and the `x` value).\n6.  **`Take`**: Used to declare an arbitrary variable for a \"for all\" claim (e.g., for `r > 0`).\n7.  **`Indeed,`**: Used to justify that a chosen value satisfies the specified conditions for a `Choose` step.\n8.  **`It suffices to show that`**: Used to simplify a goal by stating an equivalent or sufficient condition.\n9.  **Chains of (in)equalities**: Used with the `&` syntax to show `min(r/2, 1) \u2264 r/2 < r`.\n10. **`We show both statements.`**: Used to prove a conjunction (e.g., `x < 1` AND `x \u2265 0`).\n11. **`Either ... or ... --- Case ...`**: Used for proof by cases, ensuring different indentation symbols for nested cases.\n12. **`Contradiction.`**: The final statement to complete the proof by contradiction.\n\n## Waterproof Proof\n\n```\nProof.\nWe need to show that (\u00ac ([0,1) is _closed_)).\nWe argue by contradiction.\nAssume that (\u2200 a, (\u211d\\[0, 1)) a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), x \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1))) (Ass_complement_open_def).\n\nWe need to show that (\u2203 a, (a \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1)) \u2227 (\u00ac (a is an _interior point_ of \u211d\\[0, 1)))).\nChoose a := (1).\n\n* Indeed, (1 \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1)).\n\n* We need to show that (\u00ac (1 is an _interior point_ of \u211d\\[0, 1))).\n  We need to show that (\u2200 r > 0, \u2203 x \u2208 B(1, r), x \u2208 [0, 1)).\n\n  Take r > 0.\n  We need to show that (\u2203 x \u2208 B(1, r), x \u2208 [0, 1)).\n\n  Choose x := (1 - min(r/2, 1)).\n\n  - Indeed, (x \u2208 B(1, r)).\n    It suffices to show that (|x - 1| < r).\n    It holds that (|x - 1| = |(1 - min(r/2, 1)) - 1| = |-min(r/2, 1)| = min(r/2, 1)).\n    It holds that (min(r/2, 1) \u2264 r/2).\n    It holds that (r/2 < r).\n    We conclude that (& min(r/2, 1) \u2264 r/2 < r).\n\n  - Indeed, (x \u2208 [0, 1)).\n    We show both statements.\n    -- We need to show that (x < 1).\n       It holds that (min(r/2, 1) > 0).\n       We conclude that (x = 1 - min(r/2, 1) < 1).\n    -- We need to show that (x \u2265 0).\n       Either (r/2 < 1) or (r/2 \u2265 1).\n       --- Case (r/2 < 1).\n           It holds that (min(r/2, 1) = r/2).\n           We conclude that (x = 1 - r/2 \u2265 0).\n       --- Case (r/2 \u2265 1).\n           It holds that (min(r/2, 1) = 1).\n           We conclude that (x = 1 - 1 = 0).\n\nWe have shown that (1 \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1)).\nBy (Ass_complement_open_def) it holds that ((1 \u2208 \u211d\\[0, 1)) \u21e8 (1 is an _interior point_ of \u211d\\[0, 1))).\nIt holds that (1 is an _interior point_ of \u211d\\[0, 1)).\nWe have shown that (\u00ac (1 is an _interior point_ of \u211d\\[0, 1))).\nContradiction.\nQed.\n```",
