Interpretation of the statement in natural language:**\n\nThe lemma `not_open : \u00ac ([0,1) is _open_)` states that \"The interval `[0,1)` is not an open set.\"\nThe problem provides crucial context for the definition of \"open\" through its initial `We need to show that` lines in the proof block:\n`We need to show that (\u00ac (\u2200 a, [0, 1) a \u21e8 a is an _interior point_ of [0, 1))).`\n`We need to show that (\u00ac (\u2200 a, [0, 1) a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), x \u2208 [0, 1))).`\nThese lines specify that the full definition of `([0,1) is _open_)` in this context is the statement enclosed by the innermost parentheses in the second `We need to show that` line: `(\u2200 a, [0, 1) a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), x \u2208 [0, 1))`.\n\nTherefore, the lemma's goal is to prove the negation of this precise statement. To prove `\u00ac P` by contradiction, we must assume `P` (the positive statement) and then show that this assumption leads to a logical inconsistency. Crucially, we must use the exact syntax the system expects for `P`.\n\n**2. Natural Language Proof:**\n\nWe want to prove that the interval `[0,1)` is not an open set.\nOur proof strategy will be by contradiction.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that `[0,1)` *is* an open set. Based on the detailed definition provided (from the problem's implicit interpretation), this means we assume:\n` (\u2200 a, [0,1) a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), [0,1) x)`.\n\nNow, we need to find a point that contradicts this assumption.\nConsider the specific point `a = 0`. We know that `[0,1) 0` (meaning `0` is an element of `[0,1)`).\nGiven our assumption that `[0,1)` is open, for `a = 0`, there *must* exist a specific positive `r` (let's name it `r_val`) such that for any point `x` in the open ball `B(0, r_val)` (i.e., the interval `(-r_val, r_val)`), it must also be true that `[0,1) x` (meaning `x` is in `[0,1)`).\n\nTo derive a contradiction, we need to find an `x` such that `x` is in `B(0, r_val)` but is *not* in `[0,1)`.\nLet's choose `x = -r_val / 2`.\nFirst, we verify that `x = -r_val / 2` is indeed within `B(0, r_val)`:\n- Since `r_val > 0`, it follows that `r_val / 2 > 0`.\n- Thus, `-r_val < -r_val / 2` (because `-r_val` is farther left on the number line than `-r_val / 2`).\n- Also, `-r_val / 2 < r_val` (as any negative number is less than any positive number).\nSo, `(- r_val / 2) \u2208 B(0, r_val)` is confirmed.\n\nNow, based on our initial assumption that `[0,1)` is open, since `(- r_val / 2)` is within `B(0, r_val)`, it *must* logically follow that `[0,1) (- r_val / 2)` (meaning `-r_val / 2` is in `[0,1)`).\n\nHowever, let's examine the actual definition of `[0,1)`. For any number `y` to be in `[0,1)`, it must satisfy `0 \u2264 y < 1`.\nSince `r_val > 0`, it means `r_val / 2` is strictly positive, and consequently `-r_val / 2` is strictly negative (`-r_val / 2 < 0`).\nA number that is strictly less than `0` cannot satisfy the condition `0 \u2264 y`.\nTherefore, `[0,1) (- r_val / 2)` is *false*; `-r_val / 2` *cannot* be an element of `[0,1)`.\n\nWe have arrived at a direct contradiction: our initial assumption led us to conclude that `[0,1) (- r_val / 2)` is true, yet our direct analysis shows that `[0,1) (- r_val / 2)` is false.\nThis contradiction proves that our initial assumption (that `[0,1)` is an open set) must be false.\nThus, `[0,1)` is not an open set.\n\n**3. Planned Tactics from the Tutorial:**\n\n*   **12. Argue by contradiction:** The main proof strategy. We will begin with `We argue by contradiction.` and then `Assume that` the explicit definition.\n*   **6. Make an assumption:** Used to introduce the assumption for contradiction, labeled as `(i)`.\n*   **2. We need to show that:** Used repeatedly to clarify the current sub-goal.\n*   **10. Use a *for-all* statement:** We will `Use a := (0)` to instantiate the universal quantifier from our main assumption `(i)`. This requires proving the `Indeed` condition related to `[0,1) 0`.\n*   **11. Use a *there-exists* statement:** After applying the `for-all`, we will obtain an `exists r` statement. We will then `Obtain such a r` to get a concrete `r_val` to work with.\n*   **14. Prove two statements: A \u2227 B:** Used when showing that `(- r_val / 2)` is within `B(0, r_val)`, as this involves proving two separate inequalities. The `We show both statements.` syntax will be used, with `*` for the first level and `-` for the second to vary indentation symbols.\n*   **1. We conclude that:** Standard way to finalize a logical step or sub-proof.\n*   **Syntax precision:** A critical focus will be on the exact notation provided by the problem's own `We need to show that` lines, specifically using `[0,1) x` for set membership of `x` in `[0,1)`, and ensuring `[0,1)` has no internal space as used in the lemma statement.\n\n**4. Waterproof Proof:**\n\n```\nProof.\nWe argue by contradiction.\nAssume that (\u2200 a, [0,1) a \u21e8 \u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(a, r), [0,1) x) (i).\n\nWe need to show that ([0,1) 0).\nWe conclude that ([0,1) 0).\n\nUse a := (0) in (i).\n* Indeed, ([0,1) 0).\n* It holds that (\u2203 r > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 B(0, r), [0,1) x) (j).\n\nObtain such a r (r_val).\n* It holds that (r_val > 0) (k).\n* It holds that (\u2200 x \u2208 B(0, r_val), [0,1) x) (l).\n\nWe need to show that (- r_val / 2 \u2208 B(0, r_val)).\nWe show both statements.\n- We need to show that (- r_val < - r_val / 2).\n  By (k) we conclude that (- r_val < - r_val / 2).\n- We need to show that (- r_val / 2 < r_val).\n  By (k) we conclude that (- r_val / 2 < r_val).\n\nWe need to show that ([0,1) (- r_val / 2)).\nUse x := (- r_val / 2) in (l).\n* Indeed, (- r_val / 2 \u2208 B(0, r_val)).\n* It holds that ([0,1) (- r_val / 2)) (m).\n\nWe need to show that (\u00ac ([0,1) (- r_val / 2))).\nBy (k) we conclude that (r_val / 2 > 0).\nWe conclude that (- r_val / 2 < 0).\nContradiction.\nQed.\n```",
