    "prompt": "You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. \nYou must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. \nAll of the syntax rules that you need are contained in a tutorial below. \nThe syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. \nPay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. \nBe as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple \"for all\" or \"there exists\" steps, add an updated \"We need to show that...\" line to the proof each time you address such a step. \nIt is always fine to recall what needs to be shown, hence it is better to add such a step than to omit one.\nVERY IMPORTANT: When using multiple levels of indentation for focusing goals, avoid repeating the same symbol for deeper levels. \nFor example, if you've used an asterisk (*) at one level, use a different symbol, like a hyphen (-), for the next.\nBelow is the tutorial:\n\n***tutorial***\n\nYour final output should be pure Waterproof code, starting with \"Proof.\" and ending with \"Qed.\". Do not enclose it in a code block and do not use backticks, simple plaintext is best. \nBelow is the lemma to be proven: \n",
