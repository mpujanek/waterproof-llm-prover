You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. 
You must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. 
All of the syntax rules that you need are contained in a tutorial below. 
The syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. 
Pay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. 
Be as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple "for all" or "there exists" steps, add an updated "We need to show that..." line to the proof each time you address such a step. 
It is always fine to recall what needs to be shown, hence it is better to add such a step than to omit one.
VERY IMPORTANT: When using multiple levels of indentation for focusing goals, avoid repeating the same symbol for deeper levels. 
For example, if you've used an asterisk (*) at one level, use a different symbol, like a hyphen (-), for the next.
Below is the tutorial:

For your convenience, here are the definitions you can use in constructing the proof:

Your final output should be pure Waterproof code, starting with "Proof." and ending with "Qed.". Do not enclose it in a code block and do not use backticks, simple plaintext is best. 
Below is the lemma to be proven:
