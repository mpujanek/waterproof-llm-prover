You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. 
You must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. 
The syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. 
Pay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. 
Be as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple "for all" or "there exists" steps, add an updated "We need to show that..." line to the proof each time you address such a step. It is always better to add such a step than to omit one.
As your output, provide everything found between the "Proof." line and the "Qed." line in Waterproof syntax.
Make sure you also follow the syntax (& x < y < z) for multiple (in)equalities, as detailed in the tutorial. 
VERY IMPORTANT, CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING RESULT: When using indentation blocks multiple times, avoid repeating the same symbol. For example, if you've already used an asterisk (*) in one indentation block, use a different symbol like a hyphen (-) for the next. This also applies to using multiple indentation levels - when changing indentation depth, also change the symbol you use.
Below is the lemma to be proven:
