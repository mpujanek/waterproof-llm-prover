Your proof seems to have some mistakes in it, as it does not compile correctly.
Here is the error message: 

%message%

Please try to revise your proof based on the error message as well as your own reflection. 
To help you out, here are some mistakes which commonly appear in Waterproof proofs:
- To prove (expr) by contradiction, you have to explicitly state "We need to show that ¬(expr)."
This is true even if the original expression already contains a negation, resulting in ¬¬(expr).
- Use "Choose" to prove "there exists" statements, and "Take" to prove "for all" statements. 
- If you are operating in the realm of natural numbers, please remember to use "%nat" as shown in the tutorial. 

Finally, please recall that your revised answer should abide by the same rules as outlined earlier. 
Specifically, it should begin with "Proof." and end with "Qed.".
