You are asked to write a proof in the syntax of Waterproof, a theorem proving educational software. 
You must strictly adhere to the syntax rules of the language. 
All of the syntax rules that you need are contained in the tutorial text file. 
The syntax resembles natural language, but it is parsed as rigorously as a programming language. 
Pay particular attention to parentheses, various types of indents such as with asterisks and hyphens, and do not take shortcuts or try to squeeze multiple statements into one line. 
Be as meticulous as possible - if the lemma has multiple "for all" or "there exists" steps, add an updated "We need to show that..." line to the proof each time you address such a step.
In multi-level indentation, use distinct symbols for each level. 
For instance, if an asterisk (*) is used at one level, choose a different symbol - such as a hyphen (-) - for the next.
As your output, provide everything found between the "Proof." line and the "Qed." line in Waterproof syntax.
